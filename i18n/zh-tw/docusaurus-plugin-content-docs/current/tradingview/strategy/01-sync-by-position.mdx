- **`Fixed Quote Amount`:** Trade a fixed quote amount (entry value). _E.g., an entry value of 100U opens a position worth 100U._
- **`Fixed Base Amount`:** Trade a fixed base asset amount (entry value). _E.g., an entry value of 1ETH opens a position worth 1ETH._
- **`Percentage of Balance with Compounding`:** Trade a percentage (entry value) of your balance, including profits. _E.g., with 100U, a 10% trade uses 10U, and the next 10% trade uses 9U from the remaining 90U._
- **`Percentage of Initial Balance Only`:** Trade a percentage (entry value) of your initial balance, excluding profits. _E.g., with 100U, even if it grows to 130U, a 10% trade uses 10U, based on the initial 100U._
- **`Percentage of Balance at No Position`:** When adding to a position, use a percentage (entry value) of your total balance when no position is open. _E.g., with 100U (no position), entering 10% and another 20% uses 10U and 20U._
- **`Strategy Percentage with Fixed Capital`:** Use a fixed capital amount (entry value) to calculate the investment percentage. This could be the equity of your TradingView strategy or a fixed investment amount.
